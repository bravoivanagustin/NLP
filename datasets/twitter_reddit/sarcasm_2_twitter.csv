 'this continues to the present day , she said . boundary making is what s crucial here . therefore , she said , excluding trans people is a way of keeping one s position or status .'
 'keeping trans women out is , prof . sally hines said , regulating who can belong to a category in order to close down membership , in order to protect the rights of a dominant majority white women .'
 'prof . emejulu prof . vanita sundaram argue that for feminism to really deliver equality emancipation , it must also focus on problems women face as a result of oppression on basis of factors other than their sex in particular race , class , sexuality , disability , gender identity .'
 'prof . sundaram my own research area is violence vs women girls , and we know that trans women are more vulnerable to violence , harassment , and everyday abuse than other groups of women . so as a feminist and academic , it s my responsibility to advocate for that group of women .'
 'so it has to be a feminism that challenges patriarchy and other systems of hierarchy that are used to oppress , gender identity being one of them , prof . sundaram .'
 'one of the reasons that a war over trans rights has raged more intensely among feminists in the you . k . than in the us , said prof . alison phipps , is the blame has been put on to the wrong group , and trans people are carrying the can for problems that are not of their making .'
 'the idea that simplifying trans women s legal recognition would lead to increase in attacks in toilets or prisons was unfounded . prof . phipps said evidence doesn t show trans women to be anything like as sexually violent as men ... while instead being even more likely to be victims'

0,USER ahhh ! so trump planned the mournful protesters at the us embassy on new year s eve !,"['1 . i ve had a chance to check in with sources , including two us officials who had intelligence briefings after the strike on suleimani . here is what i ve learned . according to them , the evidence suggesting there was to be an imminent attack on american targets is razor thin .'
 '2 . in fact the evidence pointing to that came as three discrete facts a a pattern of travel showing suleimani was in syria , lebanon iraq to meet with shia proxies known to have an offensive position to the us . as one source said that s just business as usual for suleimani'
 '3 . more intriguing was b information indicating suleimani sought the supreme leader s approval for an operation . he was told to come to tehran for consultation and further guidance , suggesting the operation was a big deal but again this could be anything .'
 '4 . and finally , a and b were read in the context of c iran s increasingly bellicose position towards american interests in iraq , including the attack that killed a you . s . contractor and the recent protest outside the american embassy .'
 '5 . but as one source put it a b c is hardly evidence of an imminent attack on american interests that could kill hundreds , as the white house has since claimed . the official describes the reading of the intelligence as an illogical leap .'
 '6 . one official described the planning for the strike as chaotic . the official says that following the attack on an iraqi base which killed an american contractor circa dec . 27 , trump was presented a menu of options for how to retaliate . killing suleimani was the far out option'
 '7 . trump chose a more moderate option which involved the dec . 29 strikes on the positions of an iranian backed militia . then came the protest at the gates of the us embassy in baghdad'
 '8 . it was after the embassy protests that the president , according to one us official , chose the suleimani option , but the problem at that point in time is that american intelligence did not know his precise whereabouts . they scrambled to locate him , says the official .'
 '9 . according to the official , the strike on suleimani was pulled together so quickly that initially the us was not sure pmf leader abu mahdi al muhandis was in the convoy . he was also killed and is also viewed as an iranian proxy'
 '10 . since the strike , iran has convened its national security chiefs . chatter intercepted by american intelligence indicates they re considering a range of options . cyberattacks , attacks on oil facilities and american personnel and diplomatic outposts have all been cited so far .'
 '11 . but among the menu options that i had not heard before were 1 kidnapping and execution of american citizens . this might explain why the state department has ordered the evacuation of all us citizens in iraq , not just government and embassy employees .'
 '12 . another is attacks on american diplomatic and military outposts not just in iraq , lebanon and syria , but as far afield as uae and bahrain . the official i spoke to was particularly concerned for american troops stationed in iraq , some of whom are co located with shia militias'
 '13 . how does this impact the war against isis ? i turned to USER for insight . he s studied iraq since the 1990s . what he told me is that months before the strike that killed suleimani , the tensions with iran had already degraded america s ability to fight isis in iraq'
 '14 . in 2019 , america has been denied airspace and access to operations in iraq to go after isis at the behest of iran backed groups . the us has also been told to stop communicating with sunni tribes . these are important setbacks that have already weakened the us posture in iraq'
 '15 . it s all been downhill , USER told me , in terms of america s access to the isis battlespace in recent months due to iranian pressure on iraqi officials . one upshot ? us special operations forces have been on the offensive in diyala , nineveh and kirkuk provinces'
 '16 . a likely outcome of the recent strike is that small , out of the way outposts for special operations forces will be deemed too vulnerable and will be eliminated . fighting isis is no longer the priority if the outer wall of the us embassy is being attacked .'
 '17 . before i go back to the pool let me just say the obvious no one s trying to downplay suleimani s crimes . the question is why now ? his whereabouts have been known before . his resume of killing by proxy is not a secret . hard to decouple his killing from the impeachment saga .']",twitter

0,USER ahhh ! so trump planned the mournful protesters at the us embassy on new year s eve !,"['1 . i ve had a chance to check in with sources , including two us officials who had intelligence briefings after the strike on suleimani . here is what i ve learned . according to them , the evidence suggesting there was to be an imminent attack on american targets is razor thin .'
 '2 . in fact the evidence pointing to that came as three discrete facts a a pattern of travel showing suleimani was in syria , lebanon iraq to meet with shia proxies known to have an offensive position to the us . as one source said that s just business as usual for suleimani'
 '3 . more intriguing was b information indicating suleimani sought the supreme leader s approval for an operation . he was told to come to tehran for consultation and further guidance , suggesting the operation was a big deal but again this could be anything .'
 '4 . and finally , a and b were read in the context of c iran s increasingly bellicose position towards american interests in iraq , including the attack that killed a you . s . contractor and the recent protest outside the american embassy .'
 '5 . but as one source put it a b c is hardly evidence of an imminent attack on american interests that could kill hundreds , as the white house has since claimed . the official describes the reading of the intelligence as an illogical leap .'
 '6 . one official described the planning for the strike as chaotic . the official says that following the attack on an iraqi base which killed an american contractor circa dec . 27 , trump was presented a menu of options for how to retaliate . killing suleimani was the far out option'
 '7 . trump chose a more moderate option which involved the dec . 29 strikes on the positions of an iranian backed militia . then came the protest at the gates of the us embassy in baghdad'
 '8 . it was after the embassy protests that the president , according to one us official , chose the suleimani option , but the problem at that point in time is that american intelligence did not know his precise whereabouts . they scrambled to locate him , says the official .'
 '9 . according to the official , the strike on suleimani was pulled together so quickly that initially the us was not sure pmf leader abu mahdi al muhandis was in the convoy . he was also killed and is also viewed as an iranian proxy'
 '10 . since the strike , iran has convened its national security chiefs . chatter intercepted by american intelligence indicates they re considering a range of options . cyberattacks , attacks on oil facilities and american personnel and diplomatic outposts have all been cited so far .'
 '11 . but among the menu options that i had not heard before were 1 kidnapping and execution of american citizens . this might explain why the state department has ordered the evacuation of all us citizens in iraq , not just government and embassy employees .'
 '12 . another is attacks on american diplomatic and military outposts not just in iraq , lebanon and syria , but as far afield as uae and bahrain . the official i spoke to was particularly concerned for american troops stationed in iraq , some of whom are co located with shia militias'
 '13 . how does this impact the war against isis ? i turned to USER for insight . he s studied iraq since the 1990s . what he told me is that months before the strike that killed suleimani , the tensions with iran had already degraded america s ability to fight isis in iraq'
 '14 . in 2019 , america has been denied airspace and access to operations in iraq to go after isis at the behest of iran backed groups . the us has also been told to stop communicating with sunni tribes . these are important setbacks that have already weakened the us posture in iraq'
 '15 . it s all been downhill , USER told me , in terms of america s access to the isis battlespace in recent months due to iranian pressure on iraqi officials . one upshot ? us special operations forces have been on the offensive in diyala , nineveh and kirkuk provinces'
 '16 . a likely outcome of the recent strike is that small , out of the way outposts for special operations forces will be deemed too vulnerable and will be eliminated . fighting isis is no longer the priority if the outer wall of the us embassy is being attacked .'
 '17 . before i go back to the pool let me just say the obvious no one s trying to downplay suleimani s crimes . the question is why now ? his whereabouts have been known before . his resume of killing by proxy is not a secret . hard to decouple his killing from the impeachment saga .']",twitter

 'i know they are 5th graders . but responses thoughtfulness earlier earned real talk on difficult subjects . they got it . jail does not help people that are already victims . but she the judge seemed so nice earlier . what happens now ? hands raising right left . but next case'

 'hand raised . girl who had not spoken . the people really seem to like their public defenders . told them how impt it is to build trust w people you represent vice versa . how everyone has so much in common w each other even if we could not seem more different . how difficult it often is .'
 'young girl lead out next . robbery charge for stealing jewelry from cousin during fight . prosecution again consents to release good on them . but requests , as always , a stay away order . colleague raises issues that may arise at family functions . judge allows incidental contact .'
 'lessons 1 again , power of prosecutors to limit jail good . 2 prosecutors power to not charge the highest possible charge as they did here knowing that it really is no more than a family fight bad . 3 the impact that orders of protection can have , esp on family members .'
 'last case students saw charge of 1st degree robbery . claim client pretended to have firearm in pocket . stole chain money from someone in store . prosecution requested 25k bail . a woman in the audience cried out at the amount . the students all looked . whispers it is his mom .'

 'colleague proceeded in close touch with our office . mother in audience . cannot possibly afford anything close to 50k note mistake above in thread . prosecution asked for 50k . making all current court appearances . case will go nowhere . please release him . bail set 25k .'

 'walked out of court , past mom crying w his attorney , sat down on benches . answered the girl he cannot afford 25k . most of my clients cannot afford 100 . explained bail was supposed to be incentive . law only allows bail enough to ensure return to court . they were thinking .'
 'then why did she set bail higher than he could pay if she knew he could not afford it ? explained judges are human . humans driven by fear . nothing bad could happen to her if he goes to jail . but if she did right , legal thing , she could lose her job if anything bad happened .'
 'another girl but if law says you cannot do bail higher than they can afford , did not she just commit a crime ? no , but she violated state law constitution . a boy what happens to her then ? me we appeal arguing she abused her discretion . they usually get denied . why ?'
 'because the judges reviewing bail decisions work in the same courts know her . they work together . how do you think she would feel if one of our colleagues said she abused her discretion . really bad . remember again , all judges are human . all too often , feelings trump law .'
 'students had hard time wrapping their heads around how judge could just do that get away w it . it is hard , frankly , for me to wrap my head around . explained it is also about incentives . if we celebrate mercy , leniency , rationality more across system , we would all be better off .'
